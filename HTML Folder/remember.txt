Layout width/height: Use vw, vh, % for responsiveness.
Font sizes: Use rem for consistency across devices.
Padding/margin: Use % or em for flexible spacing.
Images: Use max-width: 100% to ensure images resize within their containers.

Best Practices for Compatibility:
Avoid fixed pixel sizes (px) for width, height, and font sizes.
Use relative or viewport-based units (%, vw, vh, rem, em) for a more responsive design.
Combine with media queries to handle different screen sizes and device types effectively.
